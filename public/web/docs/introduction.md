Introduction
===================
-------------------
The Virtual World Framework (VWF) provides a synchronized collaborative 3D environment for the web browser. VWF allows for easy application creation, and provides a simple interface to allow multiple users to interact with the state of the application that is synchronized across clients. 

VWF leverages existing web-based standards, infrastructure, and emerging technologies with the intent of establishing a powerful yet simple to use platform that is built on top of the next generation of web browsers. The same concepts will get you this shared 3D environment. VWF applications run directly in browser with no additional plugins.

-------------------

**Technology**

The underlying technology of VWF includes:

* WebGL, a high performance rendering engine for 3D on the web.

* Modern javascript and ECMAScript5, a more standardized programming environment.

* WebSockets, providing high performance communication. 

-------------------

**Audience**

The developer's guide is designed for those with web development skills (HTML5, JavaScript, etc), and will serve as a guide to the user creating applications with the Virtual World Framework. 

-------------------

**Using VWF**

The Virtual World Framework is a server package and zero-install client. Demo application can be directly run on the [VWF website](http://virtualworldframework.com/web/catalog.html). A server can be set up locally to build new applications. Please download the source packages from [github](https://github.com/virtual-world-framework/vwf) and follow the readme and [installation instructions](install.html) to start your own server.

-------------------

**Requirements**

Review the [requirements](reqs.html) page to ensure the basic requirements of VWF have been met. 

-------------------

**Sample Tutorials**

To get started, please view the sample step by step guides to building an application within the framework. The [first example](readme.html) walks through the basic components of an application, and serves as a *Hello World* for the Virtual World Framework.

The [second example](tutorial.html) is a basic tutorial that consists of four stages, bringing the developer from the creation of a primitive scene to a simple sandtable application. 

-------------------

**Troubleshooting**

The following resources may be helpful for troubleshooting any issues that arise.

* Verify [installation instructions](install.html) were followed.

* Load an application, and verify all the requirements are met on the loading screen. 

* Open the developer console to check for any error messages. 

	* In Google Chrome, press Ctrl+Shift+J or select the tools menu -> Tools -> Developer Tools -> JavaScript Console.
