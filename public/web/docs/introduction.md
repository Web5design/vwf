Introduction
===================
-------------------
The Virtual World Framework (VWF) connects robust 3D, immersive, entities with other entities, virtual worlds, content and users via web browsers. It provides the ability for client-server programs to be delivered in a lightweight manner via web browsers, and provides synchronization for multiple users to interact with common objects and environments.

VWF leverages existing web-based standards, infrastructure, and emerging technologies with the intent of establishing a powerful yet simple to use platform that is built on top of the next generation of web browsers. The next big 3D platform is simply the web browser, and the Virtual World Framework helps unleash its potential. 

The same concepts will get you this shared 3D environment. VWF application run directly in browser with no additional plugins.

**Audience**

The developer's guide is designed for those with web development skills (HTML5, JavaScript, etc), and will serve as a guide to the user creating applications with the Virtual World Framework. 

-------------------

**Using VWF**

The Virtual World Framework is a server package and zero-install client. Demo application can be directly run on the [VWF website](http://virtualworldframework.com/web/catalog.html). A server can be set up locally to build new applications. Please download the source packages from [github](https://github.com/virtual-world-framework) and follow the readme and [installation instructions](install.html) to start your own server.

**Sample Tutorials**

For a quick overview to get started, please view some sample step by step guides to building an application within the framework. The [first example](readme.html) walks through the basic components of an application, and serves as a *Hello World* for the Virtual World Framework.

The [second example](tutorial.html) is a basic tutorial that consists of four stages, bringing the developer from the creation of a primitive scene to a simple sandtable application.

**Troubleshooting**

The following resources may be helpful for troubleshooting any issues that arise.

* Verify [installation instructions](install.html) were followed.
* Load an application, and verify all the requirements are met on the loading screen. 

* Open the developer console to check for any error messages. In Google Chrome, select the tools menu -> Tools -> Developer Tools -> Console. In Mozilla Firefox, install and run Firebug, then select the Console window. 
* Search or post a question to the [VWF Forum](http://virtualworldframework.com/web/forum.html) for additional assistance.
